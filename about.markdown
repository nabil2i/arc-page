## Story behind ARC
Since COVID-19, it has proven necessary to not only have in person  healthcare assistance services but also virtual health care services. With a healthcare website that intends to bridge the gap between time and a user's needs, lives could be saved and better.
Oftentimes when people get sick (nothing too serious but still need to see a doctor), they encounter several challenges trying to get treated as soon as possible. The hospital could be far away from them in the city, there could be a long queue there… This is why we wanted to build **“ARC”** (African Rapid Care).
We aim to use technology to propose sustainable solutions to the problems we face daily in the different aspects of our  lives, the health domain being one of the most important ones. We ceased this opportunity to propose something that has the potential of saving people's lives.

## Our Team
We are a team of two, passionate about providing sustainable solutions to problems around us in order to make life easier and more beautiful for all.
