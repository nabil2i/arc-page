## Story behind ARC
Since COVID-19, it has proven necessary to not only have in person  healthcare assistance services but also virtual health care services. With a healthcare website that intends to bridge the gap between time and a user's needs, lives could be saved and better.
Oftentimes when people get sick (nothing too serious but still need to see a doctor), they encounter several challenges trying to get treated as soon as possible. The hospital could be far away from them in the city, there could be a long queue there…This is why we want to build “ARC” (African Rapid Care).
We aim to usse technology to propose ustainable solutions to the problems we face daily and the health domain is an important one. We ceased this opportunity to propose something that has the potention of saving people's lives.

## OurTeam
