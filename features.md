## Known bugs
* The loading of the doctors is not as fluid as expected, API calls can lag.
* There are issues when using on mobile. For example elements being shrinked... 

## Future for the App
For now the app just has some basic features and is developped for a small area only (city), and the narrowed search for doctors (only present in the design) is not yet fully implemented as it wasn't in the MVP. We have the ambition to expand the app to a larger scope, add a tailored search, add more features such as virtual appointments, emergency care and more.
