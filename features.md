## Known bugs
* The loading of the doctors is not as fluid as expected, API calls can lag.
* There are issues when using on mobile. For example elements being shrinked... 

## Future for the App
For now the app just has some basic features and is developped for a small area only (city). We have the ambition to expand the app to a larger scope, to add more features such as virtual appointments, emergency care and more.
